## 🔐 Bank-Level Security

VaultMark uses the same encryption technology trusted by:
- Online banking systems
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Government classified systems
- Military communications

### Encryption Technology:
- **AES-256-GCM**: Industry-standard authenticated encryption
- **PBKDF2**: 100,000 iterations for brute-force protection
- **Unique Salts**: 128-bit per category
- **Secure IVs**: 96-bit per bookmark

**Your encrypted bookmarks are completely unreadable without your password** - even with full disk access!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download `VaultMark.zip`
2. Extract the folder
3. Open Chrome/Edge/Brave
4. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
6. Click "Load unpacked"
7. Select the VaultMark folder
8. Done! Look for the 🔐 icon in your toolbar

### First Use

1. **Bookmark a page**: Click the extension icon, then "Bookmark"
2. **View your bookmarks**: They appear automatically in the list
3. **Encrypt a category**: Click the 🔐 icon next to any category
4. **Toggle dark mode**: Click the 🌙 icon in the header

## 🎯 How It Works

### Auto-Categorization
Bookmarks are automatically organized by website:
- Save a YouTube video → Goes to "Youtube" category
- Save a GitHub repo → Goes to "Github" category
- Rename "Youtube" to "Videos" → Still auto-categorizes correctly

### Encryption
Set a password on any category to encrypt it:
1. Click the lock icon 🔐 next to a category
2. Enter a strong password (16+ characters recommended)
3. All bookmarks in that category are instantly encrypted
4. URLs and titles become unreadable without the password
5. Even with full access to your computer, the data is gibberish

### Dark Mode
Click the moon/sun icon to toggle between light and dark themes. Your preference is saved automatically.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Strong Passwords
```
❌ Weak:   "password123"
✅ Strong: "T7$mK9#pQ2@nX4wL!v8B"
```

**Tips:**
- Use 16+ random characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Don't reuse passwords across categories
- Store in a password manager
- No dictionary words or personal info

### What Encryption Protects:
- ✅ Stolen laptop/device
- ✅ Malware scanning storage
- ✅ Forensic data recovery
- ✅ Browser storage inspection
- ✅ Data exports/syncs

### What Encryption Doesn't Protect:
- ⚠️ Weak passwords (use strong ones!)
- ⚠️ Keyloggers (keep system clean)
- ⚠️ Data in memory while unlocked (close when done)
- ⚠️ Physical coercion (someone forcing you to unlock)

## 💡 Use Cases

**Perfect for:**
- 💳 Banking and financial sites
- 🏥 Medical records and health portals
- 💼 Work credentials and internal tools
- 🔑 Password reset pages
- 📧 Email accounts
- 🔒 Any sensitive bookmarks

**Also great for:**
- 📚 Research and reference
- 🛍️ Shopping and deals
- 🎮 Gaming communities
- 📰 News and articles
- 🎨 Design inspiration

## ⚙️ Settings

Click the ⚙️ icon to customize:
- **Auto-create categories**: Toggle automatic categorization
- **Default category**: Set fallback category name when auto-create is off

## 🔄 Managing Bookmarks

### Rename Categories
- Click the ✏️ icon next to any category
- Enter new name
- Auto-categorization still works!

### Encrypt/Decrypt
- Click 🔐 to set password (encrypts bookmarks)
- Click 🔐 again to change or remove password
- Changing password re-encrypts all bookmarks

### Delete
- **Single bookmark**: Click 🗑️ next to bookmark
- **Multiple bookmarks**: Check boxes, then "Delete Selected"
- **Entire category**: Click 🗑️ next to category name

### Search
Type in the search bar to filter bookmarks by title or URL.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### No Password Recovery
**If you forget your password, your bookmarks are lost forever.**

This is the price of true encryption - even we can't recover your data. This is by design for maximum security.

**Tips:**
- Write down passwords securely
- Store in password manager
- Test with dummy bookmarks first

### Data Storage
All data is stored locally in your browser:
- No cloud sync (unless you enable browser sync)
- No external servers
- No tracking or analytics
- 100% private

## 🎨 Dark Mode

- OLED-friendly
- Toggles instantly
- Preference saved automatically
